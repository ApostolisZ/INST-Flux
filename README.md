# INST-Flux is a Matlab based software package that can infer flux distributions based on experimental labeling data. 

The framework used is the EMU framework for INST-MFA (Young et al, 2008, Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. 99, No. 3), with a different optimization algorithm, namely the built-in Matlab interior point method.

INST-FLUX requires the Matlab optimization toolbox, as well as the Matlab SDK compiler.

Installation:

To install INST-FLUX, after downloading the software, in the parent directory INST-FLUX run the command:

>>setup

the following command should terminate without any errors.

>>INST_emu('test')


For information on input files as well as directions on use please see the file "INST_Flux_documentation.pdf" in the parent directory.
